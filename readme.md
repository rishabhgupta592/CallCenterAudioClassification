Problem Statement
* The objective of this exercise is to tag conversations with the most probable topic. Given a text transcript of a conversation between two people, we want to assign it a topic that they were most likely talking about.

Approach:
* In this project I have created intent(text) classification model for predicting the intent of the call.

Steps:
* Data Visualization
* Data Cleaning
* SMOTE for class imabalance
* TD-IDF vectorizer/ count vectorizers for feature extreaction
* Keras based ANN model
* word2vec based feature extraction 
* keras based ANN model
* Evaluation
* Zero-shot experiment
